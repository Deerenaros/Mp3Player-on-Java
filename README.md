What now:
I'd thought about my architektur... and decided to rewrote all. In order to get clean code.
Also i do not want to use OrientDB, just becouse it's too hard in this project. In search in other database (ObjectDB seems good).

What must be:
Simply in use and powerfull crossplatform music player fully wroted in java. First objective is reseach java. First trouble is UI.
Working on...
